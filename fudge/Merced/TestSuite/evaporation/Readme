The files in this subdirectory contain data for energy probability
density given as the evaporation model.  Three quadrature schemes
are used, as illustrated by the input files:

in.evap-Ar38: The default uses adaptive quadrature for both incident energy
  and outgoing energy.  Its output file is out.evap-Ar38, and its run
  time is 0m0.056s.

in.evap-Ar38-Gauss6: The same data but with 6-th order Gaussian quadrature.
  Its output file is out.evap-Ar38-Gauss6, and its run time is 0m0.047s.
  We also tried 4-th order Gaussian quadrature but found its accuracy
  insufficient at low incident energies.

evap-Ar38-interpolate: For this data the integrals over outgoing energy
  are done separately, and their values are interpolated when integrating
  over incident energy.  We had thought that this approach might be faster,
  but it isn't.  The output file is out.evap-Ar38-interpolate.  This
  method is deprecated.
