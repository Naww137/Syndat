The data in this subdirectory is for parameters for the N-body phase
space model.  The input files are:

in.phaseSpace-H2: With default adaptive quadrature the output is
  out.phaseSpace-H2, and the run time is 0m6.423s.  Note that for
  the default value of quad_tol = 0.0001 the row sums agree with the
  integral of the cross section to only 4 to 6 in 10^4, so you may want
  to tighten this tolerance.  The integrand is a square root.  For Monte Carlo
  quadrature using MC_transfer the output is out.phaseSpace-H2.MC with
  nummontecarlo set to 100000.

in.phaseSpace-H2.Gauss6: This file specifies 6th-order Gaussian quadrature.
  The output file is out.phaseSpace-H2.Gauss6.
  The worst discrepancy is in the lowest relevant bin, and it is 0.1%.
