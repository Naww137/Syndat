The files in this subdirectory contain data to test model weights.
The model weight may be 1/2 for a single neutron in an (n, 2n) reaction.
Another use of this feature is for multiple interpolation regions.
In this instance, the model weight would be 1 over a range of incident
energies and 0 otherwise. 

*** Note that the model weight must be given as a histogram. ***

The test files are:

in.evap-Ar38.half: data for one neutron in an (n, 2n) reaction.  Its
  output file is out.evap-Ar38.half.

in.lower_in: data with linear-linear interpolation on a range of incident
  energies.  Its output file is out.lower_in.

in.upper_in: data with linear-log interpolation on a range of incident
  energies.  Its output file is out.upper_in.
