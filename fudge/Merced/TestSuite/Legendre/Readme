The data in this directory is the traditional I=4 representation
of energy-angle probability densities as Legendre expansions.
The get_transfer code gives the user the option of several ways to
compute the transfer matrix: adaptive quadrature, or Gaussian quadrature 
of order 2, 4, or 6.  The switch is controlled by having the line:
Quadrature method: adaptive
or
Quadrature method: GaussX, with X = 2, 4, or 6
in the input file.  This line must appear before the line,
LEEpPData: n = ??

Versions of the code 278 and earlier also permit the option: 
Quadrature method: exact.
This method uses the exact integration as described in the Omega
manual.

For adaptive quadrature use
Quadrature method: adaptive
as in the file in.Legendre-H2.  Its output is out.Legendre-H2.

For Gaussian quadrature use
Quadrature method: Gauss6
as in the file in.Legendre-H2.Gauss6.  Its output is out.Legendre-H2.Gauss6.

The code MC_merced uses MonteCarlo quadrature with 100,000 evaluations
per integral.  For the input file in.Legendre-H2 its output is 
out.Legendre-H2.MC.

For the exact formula, the input file contains the line,
Quadrature method: exact
as in the file Legendre-H2.exact.  Its output is out.Legendre-H2.
