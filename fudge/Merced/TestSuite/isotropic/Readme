The data in this directory are for testing the treatment of isotropic
distributions.  The input files are:

in.Mg24.flat: Data with histograms in outgoing energy.  Its output is
  out.Mg24.flat.

in.F19.correspondingEn: Data with interpolation in incident energy by
  cumulative points, histograms in outgoing energy.  Its output is
  out.F19.correspondingEn.

in.F19.linlin-cumpoints:  Data with interpolation in incident energy by
  cumulative points, linear-linear in outgoing energy.  Its output is
  out.F19.linlin-cumpoints.

in.F19.gammas: Data with cumulative points interpolation but having
  intervals of outgoing energy with zero probability.  The output
  is out.F19.gammas.

in.Co58uncor.table: Probability densities as a table with linear-linear
  interpolation.  The output is out.Co58uncor.table.

in.uncorrelated-Li7.cm: Isotropic energy probability density given in center-of-
  mass coordinates.  The output is out.uncorrelated-Li7.cm.

in.Co59.linlog: Isotropic energy probability density given in the lab
  frame, with lin-log unitbase interpolation for incident energy.
  The output file is out.Co59.linlog.
