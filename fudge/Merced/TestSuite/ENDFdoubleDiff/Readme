The data in this subdirectory is of ENDF-style energy-angle
joint probability densities.  The files are as follows:

in.ENDFdoubleDiff-Be9: The original ENDF data integrated using adaptive
  quadrature.  Its output is out.ENDFdoubleDiff-Be9.
  The output of this file from MC_merced is out.ENDFdoubleDiff-Be9.MC.

in.ENDFdoubleDiff-Be9.Gauss6: The original ENDF data integrated using Gaussian
  quadrature or order 6.  Its output is out.ENDFdoubleDiff-Be9.Gauss6.
