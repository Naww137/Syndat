The data in this subdirectory is for energy probability densities for
delayed fission neutrons using the ENDF general evaporation model.  These
tables are independent of the energy of the incident neutron.  The input
files are:

in.genEvap-Pa231: Use the default adaptive quadrature.  The output file
  is out.genEvap-Pa231.  This file has Theta = 1.

in.genEvap-Pa231.Gauss2: Use 2nd-order Gaussian quadrature.  The output file
  is out.genEvap-Pa231.Gauss2. This output is the same as out.genEvap-Pa231.

in.U235_delayedNeutron_MeV: This file has Theta = 1.0e-6.  The output is
  out.U235_delayedNeutron_MeV.
