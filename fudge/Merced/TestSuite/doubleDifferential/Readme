The first two data in this subdirectory are traditional ENDL I=3
double-differential energy-angle probability densities for outgoing
particles.

The final two input files use a special GND format for tabular
double-differential tables.

The ENDL I=3 input files are as follows:

in.doubleDiff-Fe57: Uses the default adaptive quadrature.  The output file is
  out.doubleDiff-Fe57.

in.Be9_n-2n: this files uses the ENDL kludge, using a copy to create data
  at the threshold.  The output file is out.Be9_n-2n.

in.cum_points: a file to test cumulative points interpolation of the
  energy distributions.  The output file is out.cum_points.

The special GND files are
in.B11: These data are in the center-of-mass frame.  The output file
  is out.B11.

in.B11.lab: These data are in the laboratory frame.  The output
  file is out.B11.lab.
