The data in this subdirectory are for Kalbach-Mann parameters
for energy-angle probability densities for incomplete equilibrium
reactions.  

**Note**: The ENDF files for these data always specify that the
interpolation with respect to incident energy be direct linear-linear,
even thought this makes no sense physically.  The mcnp manual
says that the outgoing energy probability densities are to be
interpolated unit base, and that is our default.  For the sake of
comparison, we implemented direct linear-linear interpolation of the
incident energy in the input file: Kalbach-Fe57.direct.

The input files are:

in.Kalbach-Fe57: Integrate using adaptive quadrature.  The output file
  is out.Kalbach-Fe57.  The output file from the Monte Carlo code
  is out.Kalbach-Fe57.MC.

in.Kalbach-Fe57.Gauss6: Integrate using 6th-order Gaussian quadrature.
  The output file is out.Kalbach-Fe57.Gauss6.

in.Kalbach-Fe57.direct: This file specifies linear-linear truncated direct
  interpolation with respect to incident energy.

in.Kalbach-Fe57.directExtrapolate: This file specifies linear-linear
  extrapolated direct interpolation with respect to incident energy.
  The output using adaptive quadrature
  is out.Kalbach-Fe57.directExtrapolate and with Monte Carlo quadrature it is
  out.Kalbach-Fe57.directExtrapolate.MC.

in.Kr78Kalbach: Most Kalbach data specify that interpolation with respect
  to outgoing energy be histogram.  This file uses linear-linear interpolation.

in.gamma_in: A sample of photonuclear data.  Its output is out.gamma_in.
