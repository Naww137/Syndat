The data in this subdirectory are taken from the EPDL library, and it
is for Compton scattering.  In the ScatteringFactorData
we have kept the units of the first variable as 1/cm (reciprocal
wavelength).  In order to convert this to MeV, the get_transfer code
multiplies this by 2*pi*c*hbar.

Note that the input files do not contain cross sections; these
are derived from the ScatteringFactorData and are printed in the output.

The input files are:

in.Compton: Use the default adaptive quadrature.  The output file is
  out.Compton.  The output from the Monte Carlo version of the code
  is out.Compton.MC.
