This directory contains test files and sample output for the getTransferMatrix code.

command line.
  skip_logging # default  0       // if == 1, don't log errors in documentation.txt file
  message_level # default 2       // four levels of messages - info, warn, debug, none
                                // 0: only fatal errors
                                // 3: only information messages and fatal errors
                                // 2: warnings, information messages, and fatal errors
				// 1: debugging information plus all the rest
  datafield_precision # default 8 // 8 sig-figs in all data fields
  num_threads # default 0 // the number of threads in parallel computing,
                          // the default lets the computer decide
  outputLegendreOrder  # default 3  // Legendre order of the transfer matrix
  kinetics # default Newtonian  // relativistic is an option for discrete 2-body

  quad_tol_floor # default 1.0e-5 // do not do adaptive quadrature on high-order
                                  // entries of the of the transfer matrix smaller
				  // than this
  quad_weight_increase # default 2.5 // for a Legendre coefficient of order j,
                                     // the tolerance in the adaptive quadrature

  short_interval # default 1e-12 // terminate the adaptive quadrature when the
                                 // subintervals get this short
  sqrt_wt_cutoff # default 0.1 // the Compton and coherent scattering routines
                               // use square-root weighted Gaussian quadrature
			       // on intervals this close to the root
  norm_tol  # default 2e-5  // the code checks the total probability of the data;
                            // a warning is given if the sum differs from 1
			    // by more than this
  check_row_sum # default  0   // if > 0, check the sums over each row
  scale_rows # default  1    // if > 0, scale the transfer matrix to enforce the
                             // check of the row sum
  E_tol # default  1.0e-10   // tolerance on hitting the corner of an energy box
  abs_tol # default  2.0e-14   // absolute tolerance if E = 0


For example, to change quad_tol, set:
quad_tol: 1.0e-6 # in the input file or
-quad_tol 1.0e-6 # in the command line


Input and output files are given only on the command line
  input # default   ""
  output # default   "utfil"
  path_to_input # default  "."
For example:
merced -output somefile.out someinputfile


The data is organized into subdirectories according to the type of data given.

*** Traditional ENDL data:

doubleDifferential: table of angular probability density for an outgoing
  particle in the laboratory frame together with a table of joint
  energy-angle probability density.  This is traditional ENDL I=1 data
  along with I=3 data.

isotropic: a table of energy probability density for an outgoing particle,
  isotropic in the laboratory frame.

Legendre: a table of Legendre coefficients for the energy probability density
  of an outgoing particle in the laboratory frame.  This is traditional ENDL
  I=4 data.

twoBody: for discrete 2-body reactions this data is a table of angular
  probability densities in the center-of-mass frame.  The reaction may be
  elastic or inelastic (with an excited residual).  This is traditional
  ENDL I=1 data.

uncorrelated: tables of uncorrelated energy and angle probability
  densities for an outgoing particle.  This is traditional ENDL I=1 data
  along with I=4 data of Legendre order 0.

*** Models used in ENDF which are not in ENDL:

ENDFdoubleDiff: ENDF-style table of joint energy-angle probability density
  in the labaoratory frame. 

ENDFLegendre: Legendre expansions of energy-angle probability density
  in the labaoratory frame.  The data is ordered according to ENDF rules.

evaporation: energy distribution as an evaporation spectrum.

GeneralEvaporation: data for energy probability densities of delayed fission
  neutrons.  This data is independent of the energy of the incident neutron.

Kalbach: data for the Kalbach-Mann model for energy-angle probability density
  in the center-of-mass coordinate system.

Legendre2Body: angular probability densities for discrete 2-body reactions
  given as Legendre expansions.  The data is in the center-of-mass frame.

Madland: data for the Madland-Nix model for fission neutrons.

Maxwell: data for the Maxwell model for fission neutrons.

phaseSpace: data for the N-body phase-space model for energy probability density
  in the center-of-mass coordinate system.

two_step: data for breakup into two particles following a discrete 2-body
  reaction.

Watt: data for the Watt model for fission neutrons.

weights: data files to test the handling of model weights.  This feature
  is typically used for one neutron in an (n, 2n) reaction or for multiple
  interpolation regions.

*** EPDL photon data:

coherent: The form factor for coherent scattering.

Compton: The scattering factor for Compton scattering.
