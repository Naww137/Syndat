The data in this subdirectory is for energy probability densities
for fission neutrons using the Maxwell model.  The input files are
as follows:

Maxwell-Th233: Use adaptive quadrature as the default.  The output
  file is out.Maxwell-Th233, and the run time was 0m0.194s.

Maxwell-Th233-Gauss2: Use 2-nd order Gaussian quadrature.  The
  output file is out.Maxwell-Th233-Gauss2, and the run time was
  0m0.077s.  Higher-order Gaussian quadrature gave essentially the
  same answers, and they took a little longer, e.g., 0m0.122s for
  4-th order Gaussian quadrature.

Maxwell-Th233.fete: The input file derived from running fete on
  the ENDF data.  The output file is out.Maxwell-Th233.fete.
