The files in this subdirectory contain data for energy probability
density for fission neutrons given as the Madland-Nix model.  Three 
quadrature schemes are used, and their run times are virually the
same.  The input files are:

in.Madland-Am241: The default uses adaptive quadrature for both incident energy
  and outgoing energy.  Its output file is out.Madland-Am241.

in.Madland-Am241.Gauss6: The same data but with 6-th order Gaussian quadrature.
  Its output file is out.Madland-Am241.Gauss6.  The accuracy is not good
  in the low outgoing energy bins.

Madland-Am241.interp: For these data the integtals over outgoing energy
  are done separately, and their values are interpolated when integrating
  over incident energy.  The output file is out.Madland-Am241.interp.  The
  accuracy is not good in the low outgoing energy bins.

Madland-Am241.high_Eout: The same file as Madland-Am241, except for the
  addition of outgoing energy bins (20, 25), (25, 30), and (30, 40) MeV.
  The output file is out.Madland-Am241.high_Eout.  The purpose of this file
  is to check the effect of truncating the Madland-Nix model at 20 MeV.
