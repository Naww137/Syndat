The data in this subdirectory are taken from the EPDL library,
and it is for coherent photon scattering.  In the FormFactorData
we have kept the units of the first variable as 1/cm (reciprocal
wavelength).  In order to convert this to MeV, the get_transfer code
multiplies this by 2*pi*c*hbar.

Note that the input files do not contain cross sections; these
are derived from the FormFactorData and are printed in the output.

The input files are:

in.coherent: Use the default adaptive quadrature with weight
  $\sqrt{ 1 - \mu }$. These data are from ENDL and have no anomalous
  factors.  The output is out.coherent.

in.coherent.Gauss2: Use 2nd-order Gaussian quadrature.  The output is
  out.coherent.Gauss2.

in.oxygen: data from ENDF which do have anomalous factor data.  The
  output is out.oxygen.
