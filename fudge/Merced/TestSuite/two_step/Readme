The data in this file are for reactions with breakup following
an inelastic discrete 2-body reaction.  For the first step of the
reaction, the masses of the incident particle, the target, and the
outgoing particle must be given, along with the Q value.  If the
mass of the residual is also given, it is checked agains the value
computed from the other information.  In any case, the computed value
is used in the computation.

Fro the breakup reaction, the masses of the outgoing particle and the
residual are given.  The Q value is computed.  The input files are:

in.two_step: data for the reaction
    H2 + H3 --> n + (He4_e1 -> H1 + H3) outgoing data for H1.
  The output file is out.two_step.

in.two_step.rel: data for the relativistic treatment of the reaction
    H2 + H3 --> n + (He4_e1 -> H1 + H3) outgoing data for H1.
  The output file is out.two_step.rel.
