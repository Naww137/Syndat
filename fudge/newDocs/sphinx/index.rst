Overview
********
The FUDGE (For Updating Data and GEnerating Evaluations) is a python based nuclear data platform that is used
to process, write, modify and view nuclear data (Beck and Mattoon, 2014). It is part of a suite of codes being 
developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to support the new General Nuclear Database 
Structure (GNDS) which was developed to mordernize the storage of nuclear data. GNDS (Brown et al., 2019) 
provides representations for cross sections and distributions, particleproduction from any reaction, photo- 
and electro-atomic interaction data, thermal neutron scattering data, and radionuclide production and decay 
data (including fission products).

It was concieved as a nested hierarchy with a `dataset`, an `element` and an `attribute` as the three essential 
building blocks (Mattoon et al., 2012). The table below lists metalanguages that have been used to represent GNDS. 
Although JSON lacks explicit support for the GNDS `attribute`, a special object with the string `attribute` as key 
and an object with the GNDS `attribute` as value.

The table also includes the representation of these building blocks in FUDGE.

The FUDGE documentation explains how the software meets the requirements for accessing GNDS files and the subsequent
processing of nuclear data for downstream applications. This description additionally incudes an overview of the 
relevant nuclear data theory and the GNDS format.

The FUDGE Nuclear Data Platform
*******************************
FUDGE is primarily written in Python, with C/C++ extensions for CPU-intensive tasks. It's design allows for usage either
interactively or via batch scripts.

As a nuclear data managing tool, FUDGE includes the following capabilites:
  - Reading and writting GNDS files;
  - Tranlation from the legacy formats ENDF-6 and ENDL;
  - Methods to confirm conformance with the GNDS format and the underlying physics;
  - Plotting;
  - Processing for Monte Carlo and deterministic transport applications.

The sections below describe the FUDGE support for GNDS followed by a description of its functionality beyond GNDS

.. todo::
   Expand sections with more detail for "GNDS Representation in FUDGE" and a section for "Fudge beyond GNDS"
