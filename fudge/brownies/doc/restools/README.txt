--------------------

    1.  Cumulative Level Distribution.  100 realizations, plotted with qtgrace.  Data
        generated by blurr/level_analysis.py, TestLevelAnalyzer_90Zr.test_level_sequence_generation.
        90Zr, l=0, jPi=1/2+ parameters.  Fig. 8.  Files:

            CLD_orig.txt

    2.  Delta3 Statistic.  100 realizations, plotted with qtgrace.  Includes systematics
        corresponding to other ensembles (clearly they are wrong!)  Data generated by
        blurr/level_analysis.py, TestLevelAnalyzer_90Zr.test_level_sequence_generation.
        90Zr, l=0, jPi=1/2+ parameters.  Fig 10.  Files:

    3.  Nearest Neighbor Spacing Distribution.  100 realizations, plotted with qtgrace.
        Includes systematics.  Data generated by blurr/level_analysis.py,
        TestLevelAnalyzer_90Zr.test_level_sequence_generation.  90Zr, l=0, jPi=1/2+
        parameters.  Fig 9.  Files:

    4.  Distant level correction (R-function, see page 63-64 of Froehner, JEFF Report 18).
        I don't know how data was generated, but the equation is very simple to code.
        90Zr, l=0, jPi=1/2+ parameters.  Plot not used in writeup currently.  Files:

            RTest.dat
            R_amplitude.agr
            R_amplitude.pdf

    5.  Transmission coefficients using Moldauer's sum rule.   Data generated by
        bin/readTLs.py unless otherwise stated.  90Zr, l=0, jPi=1/2+ parameters.
        Figs 1 & 2.  Files:

            TcTesting/
                238U_Tc/  -- empty, meant for 238U plots
                56Fe_Tc/  -- incomplete & probably the wrong version
                90Zr_Tc/
                average_cs_test.agr

                zr90-tl.tar.gz

            Tc_90Zr_capture.pdf -- Fig. 2.  The Tc for the capture channels, computed from
                ENDF/B-VII.1 90Zr RRR.

            Tc_90Zr_elastic.pdf -- Fig. 1.  The Tc for the elastic channels, computed from
                ENDF/B-VII.1 90Zr RRR and from ECIS calculations of 90Zr.

    6. Taken from average_cs_test.agr in TcTesting.  Data generated by a one-line hack in
       fudge/processing/resonances/reconstructResonances.py URRcrossSection.getURRMoments.
       Due to finite memory problems, the curve had to be computed in chunks.  There were
       enough resonances in each chunk that the contribution from distant levels was
       minimized.  90Zr, l=0, jPi=1/2+ parameters.

    10. Output from 90Zr run through NJOY2012 and PREPRO2015.  The NJOY2012 output also
        includes the PURR tables we might want to compare to.

        of the cross sections at a fixed energy.
