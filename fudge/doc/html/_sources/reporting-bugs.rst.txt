Reporting Bugs
==============

If you encounter bugs, or if you would like to request new features in FUDGE or GNDS,
please take a moment and report the issue at https://github.com/LLNL/fudge/issues. This ensures that your
request is immediately available to both developers and to other users. As the name suggests, you can also use
the tracker to keep track of the status of your bug report, including fixes or requests for more information.

If you wish to propose more extensive changes, please consider forking the project and opening a pull request.
