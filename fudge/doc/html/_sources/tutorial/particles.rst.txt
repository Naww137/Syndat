Particles
=========

Nuclei and their properties
---------------------------

GNDS evaluations store a list of all particles involved in each reaction, including the projectile and target,
outgoing products and residuals.  Some properties of reaction products (like the multiplicity and distribution data)
depend on the reaction that produced them.  Other properties (like the mass, spin and parity, charge, etc.) are
reaction-independent.  These properties are collected in the Properties of Particles (``PoPs``) section of the
``reactionSuite``.

TBD: expand description of PoPs (it is still changing rapidly to accomodate the ENDF decay sub-library).

Transportable particles
