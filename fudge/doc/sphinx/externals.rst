External Packages used in Fudge
===============================

Fudge depends on some stand-alone packages that are also maintained by the LLNL Nuclear Data and Theory group.
These 'external' packages are distributed with Fudge but have their own source tree and documentation.

pqu
---
Also known as physicalQuantitiesWithUncertainties, this is a Python package for managing values with units and
(optional) uncertainties. For more information, see the `pqu package documentation`_.

.. _pqu package documentation: ../../pqu/doc/html/index.html

numericalFunctions
------------------
A package written primarily in C that handles many of the low-level data containers used by ``Fudge`` and GNDS.
Documentation is available :download:`here <../../numericalFunctions/Doc/ptwXY.pdf>`

xData
-----
A Python module containing basic data containers such as interpolation tables, arrays, matrices and tables.
Some of the classes in xData use numericalFunctions internally for better performance.

crossSectionAdjustForHeatedTarget
---------------------------------
A package written in C for the numerically-intensive task of Doppler broadening cross sections.
Documentation is available :download:`here <../../crossSectionAdjustForHeatedTarget/Doc/crossSectionAdjustForHeatedTarget.pdf>`

PoPs
----
Properties of Particles (such as mass, spin and parity, charge and halflife) are collected together in a
particle database. The PoPs Python package is meant for reading and writing these particle databases.
See `PoPs documentation`_ for more information.

.. _PoPs documentation: ../../PoPs/Doc/html/index.html

Merced
------
A package written in C++ for computing transfer matrices for deterministic transport.
Documentation is available :download:`here <../../Merced/Doc/merced.pdf>`

statusMessageReporting
----------------------
The statusMessageReporting library provides more robust error message reporting for c codes. It is used
by other externals such as numericalFunctions and crossSectionAdjustForHeatedTarget.
