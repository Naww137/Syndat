Checking ENDF or GNDS files
===========================

Let's face it.  ENDF evaluations often have mistakes and bugs.  Fortunately `fudge` comes 
armed with a large number of pre-made checks.  Running them is as simple as running the 
``check()`` member function on any fudge class instance.  The quickest way to test an 
evaluation and its covariance is just to run the main ``check()`` function of either an 
instance of ``reactionSuite`` or ``covarianceSuite``.  ``Fudge`` will then recursively descend
through the instances and check every data member.

Checking ``reactionSuite`` instances
------------------------------------

Using the ``myEval`` and ``myCov`` instances from the previous tutorial, we find:

    >>> myEval.check()
    n + H1
    H2 + photon
    <fudge.warning.context object at 0x101cb6190>
    
Hmm... This doesn't look so helpful.  This is because ``fudge`` understand the hierarchy 
and categorizes the errors and warnings accordingly.  Try this:

    >>> print( myEval.check() )
    ReactionSuite: n + H1

    reaction label 1: H2 + gamma
        WARNING: Calculated and tabulated Q-values disagree: 2735357.48694634 eV vs 2224631 eV!

Much more useful.  In fact, you can loop over the warnings to look for specific ones:

    >>> for w in myEval.check():
    ...     if 'Q-value' in str( w ): print( w )
    ...
    reaction label 1: H2 + gamma
        WARNING: Calculated and tabulated Q-values disagree: 2735357.48694634 eV vs 2224631 eV!

In other words, the tabulated Q-value for the capture reaction (MT 102) is inconsistent with the
value calculated from incident and outgoing particle masses.
Note, you don't just get the warning or error, you get the entire context in which it occurred.  
This is very useful for bug tracking. In the example above, we can tell that the problem is in the capture
reaction by looking at the list of outgoing particles: 'H2 + gamma'.

Checking ``covarianceSuite`` instances
--------------------------------------

The covariances have ``check()`` functions too and they find all sorts of stuff:

    >>> myCov.check()
    CovarianceSuite: n + H1
        Section: H2 + gamma
            Form covarianceMatrix:
                WARNING: Ratio of smallest/largest eigenvalue (2.359558e-10) is too small

Setting up a checker script
---------------------------

We will set up a script to use ``fudge`` to check ENDF files.  I'll leave to you to figure out how
to do the same with GNDS files (if you do, remember to load both the evaluation and the covariance!).

This is what I came up with (download it :download:`here <checkendf.py>`):

::

    #! /usr/bin/env python
    import argparse
    from fudge.legacy.converting.endfFileToGNDS import endfFileToGNDS
    
    # Process command line options
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Check an ENDF file')
    parser.add_argument('inFile', type=str, help='The ENDF file you want to translate and check.' )
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    # Now translate
    results = endfFileToGNDS( args.inFile, toStdOut=True, skipBadData=True )
    myEval = results['reactionSuite']
    myCov = results['covarianceSuite']
    print( '\n\n' )
    
    # Check the evaluation
    print( "Checking evaluation for "+args.inFile )
    print( "------------------------------------------------" )
    print( myEval.check() )
    
    print( '\n' )
    
    # Check the covariance
    print( "Checking covariances for "+args.inFile )
    print( "------------------------------------------------" )
    print( myCov.check() )

Try it out!
