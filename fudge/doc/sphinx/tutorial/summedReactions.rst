Summed Reactions
================

Evaluators sometimes need to specify redundant information in an evaluation. For example, the total reaction cross section is a sum of each discrete reaction in the evaluation and could in principle be derived from those discrete reactions.
In practice, however, the total cross section is easier to measure and usually better known than any of its constituents.
It is therefore usually listed seperately in a GNDS file, as a *summedReaction*. Distributions should not be listed for summed reactions.

Other summed reactions may include inelastic (sum of all inelastic scattering reactions to different excited levels), or sums of (n,p) or (n,d) reactions to different excited levels.
